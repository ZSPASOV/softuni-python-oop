# In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (drugite sa encapsulation and inheritance)
# Through abstraction
    # We hide all but the relevant data about an object to reduce complexity and increase efficiency
    # Implementation details are hidden and must be accessed explicitly
