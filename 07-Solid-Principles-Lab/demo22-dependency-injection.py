# Software engineering technique for defining the dependencies among objects
# Why use Dependency Injection?
# Decreases coupling between a class and its dependency
# Can be applied to legacy code as a refactoring, because it doesnâ€™t require any change in code behaviour
# Allows a client to remove all knowledge of a concrete implementation that it needs to use
