# Interesting design principle by which we protect our code by making it independent of things that are fragile,
# volatile or out of our control
# Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
    # High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
    # Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
